# Table with books

I want to make a table with several books (taken from JSON file) and on that table with books to apply search (which is already implemented and seems to work well) and in addition I want to add sorting filters (by name, alphabetical order, by date added, etc). I also now have a non-functional update version implemented, I want to apply a version where I can add a new book (via a push method) from that page directly)
